# ML Conference Paper Explorer 📄🔍

Welcome to the ML Conference Paper Explorer! This project is all about
making it easy to access and explore papers from major machine
learning conferences. We scrape the abstracts, turn them into
embeddings, and display them in a user-friendly interface where you
can search and explore to your heart's content.

## Features 🌟
- Scrape abstracts from major ML conference websites.
- Convert abstracts into embeddings for advanced analysis.
- Friendly and interactive UI for exploring and searching papers.

## How to Use 🛠
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Streamlit app and enter the URL of the desired ML conference.
4. Explore the papers' abstracts through our easy-to-navigate interface.

## To-Do 📝
- [ ] Implement embedding generation for the scraped abstracts.
- [ ] Integrate embeddings into the frontend for enhanced search capabilities.
- [ ] Expand the scraping capabilities to more ML conference websites.
- [ ] Add more interactive elements to the UI for a richer user experience.
- [ ] Optimize performance for handling large datasets.
- [ ] implement a data layer for storing and retrieving the scraped data.
- [ ] separate scraping from web app.
